The keyless hash function will take in a string of ascii characters. These characters will be split into blocks of either 2 bits, 4 bits, or multiple characters. If the number of characters is odd, the first character in the string is repeated as the last character. Each block's parity is computed by XORing the first half of the block with the second half repeatedly, until 1 bit remains. Each block's parity is concatenated into a binary string z. An random S-Box is constructed with m1=|z|/4 (integer division) rows and m2=|z|-m1 columns. The first m1 bits of z are used as the row lookup, and the remaining m2 bits of z for the column lookup. The entry found this way is the output of the function.
